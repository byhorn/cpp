// struct class differs only in accessiblity
// no differece between struct vs class
// struct exists only to be compatible with c code
// c++ is now completely diverged from c
// c++ wanted to be compatible with c
// c++ wanted to keep legacy from c
// bjarmin stroustrup wanted this
// but didnt work out
// so dont use struct
