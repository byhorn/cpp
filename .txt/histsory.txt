struct class differs only in accessiblity

no differece between struct vs class

struct exists only to be compatible with c code

c++ is now completely diverged from c

c++ wanted to be compatible with c

c++ wanted to keep legacy from c

bjarmin stroustrup wanted this

but didnt work out

so dont use struct
